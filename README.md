# GridWorld
Template to allow introducing some coding concepts with gridworld

Initial task is to expand CoolBug to be able to solve the maze. There is a smaller maze and a very very large one. New ones can be generated via
https://keesiemeijer.github.io/maze-generator/#generate

Just set the wall thickness to `1` and maze entraces must be diagonal


For level 2 change `Remove maze walls` to introduce loops
